\title{BIC Value for a Discrete Time Hidden Markov Model}
\usage{
BIC_HMM(size, m, k, logL)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{length of the time-series of observations x (also \code{T})}

\item{m}{integer number of states in the Markov chain of the model}

\item{k}{single integer value representing the number of parameters of the underlying
distribution of the observation process 
(e.g. k=2 for the normal distribution (mean and standard deviation))}

\item{logL}{logarithmized likelihood of the model}
}
\value{
The AIC or BIC value of the fitted hidden Markov model.
}
\description{
Computes the Aikaike's information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion 
for a discrete time hidden Markov model, given a time-series of observations.
}
\details{
For a discrete-time hidden Markov model, AIC and BIC are as follows 
(MacDonald & Zucchini (2009, Paragraph 6.1 and A.2.3)):
\deqn{\mbox{AIC} = -2 logL + 2p}{AIC = -2 logL + 2p}
\deqn{\mbox{BIC} = -2 logL + p \log T}{BIC = -2 logL + p log(T),}
where \code{T} indicates the length/size of the observation time-series and \code{p} 
denotes the number of independent parameters of the model. In case of a HMM as 
provided by this package, where \code{k} and \code{m} are defined as in the arguments 
above, \code{p} can be calculated as follows:
  \deqn{p = m^2+km-1.}{p = m^2 + km - 1.}
