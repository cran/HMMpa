of the numerical maximization using the nlm-function (used to perform the M-step of the
Baum-Welch-algorithm). Default value is \code{50}.}

\item{DNM_limit_accuracy}{a single numerical value representing the convergence 
criterion of the numerical maximization algorithm using the \link[stats]{nlm}

of the bout intervals (see Details for the definition of bouts).  For instance,
\code{bout_lengths = c(1,1,2,2,3,10,11,20,1,20)} defines the five bout intervals
[1,1] (1 count); [2,2] (2 counts); [3,10] (3-10 counts); [11,20] (11-20 counts); 
[1,20] (1-20 counts - overlapping with other bout intervalls is possible).

\description{
This function assigns a physical activity range to each observation of a time-series
(such as a sequence of impulse counts recorded by an accelerometer) using
hidden Markov models (HMM). The activity ranges are defined by thresholds called
cut-off points.  Basically, this function combines \code{\link{HMM_training}},
\code{\link{HMM_decoding}} and \code{\link{cut_off_point_method}}.
See Details for further information.
}
\details{
The function combines \code{\link{HMM_training}}, \code{\link{HMM_decoding}} and
\code{\link{cut_off_point_method}} as follows: \cr

\bold{Step 1:} \code{\link{HMM_training}} trains the most likely HMM for a given
time-series of accelerometer counts. \cr
\bold{Step 2:} \code{\link{HMM_decoding}} decodes the trained HMM (Step 1) into the
most likely sequence of hidden states corresponding to the given time-series of
observations (respectively the most likely sequence of physical activity levels
corresponding to the time-series of accelerometer counts). \cr
\bold{Step 3}. \code{\link{cut_off_point_method}} assigns an activity range to each
accelerometer count by its hidden physical activity level (extracted in Step 2).
}
\note{
The parameter \code{ max_scaled_x } can be applied to scale the values of the
observations. This might prevent the alogrithm from numerical instabilities.
At the end, the results are internaly rescaled to the original scale.  For instance,
a value of \code{ max_scaled_x=200 } shrinks the count values of the complete
time-series \code{ x } to a maximum of 200. Training and decoding of the HMM is
carried out using the scaled time-series. \cr
From our experience, especially time-series with observations values \code{ >1500}, or
where \code{T > 1000}, show numerical instabilities. We then advice to make use of
\code{ max_scaled_x }.

The extention of the cut-off point method using a Poisson based HMM has been provided
and evaluated successfully on simulated data firstly by Barbara Brachmann in her
diploma thesis (see References).
